## Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```python
# Intelligence Orchestrator using LangGraph
workflow = StateGraph(OrchestratorState)
workflow.add_node("analyze_market_context", self._analyze_market_context)
workflow.add_node("prioritize_tasks", self._prioritize_tasks)
workflow.add_conditional_edges("monitor_execution", self._should_continue_monitoring)
```

### Graph-RAG Implementation
```python
# Dynamic knowledge graph with vector search
async def graph_rag_query(self, query: str, k: int = 5):
    query_embedding = await self.embeddings.embed_query(query)
    
    # Vector similarity + graph traversal
    vector_results = await session.run("""
        CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('document_embeddings', $k, $query_embedding)
        YIELD node, score
        RETURN node.content, score
    """)
```

### Real Data Integration
```python
# Multiple real data sources with validation
class ZillowDataSource(DataSource):
    BASE_URL = "https://files.zillowstatic.com/research/public_csvs/"
    
    async def fetch_data(self, dataset: str = 'home_values'):
        url = f"{self.BASE_URL}{self.DATASETS[dataset]}"
        # Async HTTP with validation and cleaning
```
